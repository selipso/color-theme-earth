## Thakker Light Earth Theme (High Contrast)

A light theme with a beige background and a high contrast color palette based on colors found in nature. Inspired by one of the most natural ways that we read and have been reading for thousands of years--dark text on a light background. Unlike most other themes, this theme has detailed attention to contrast for variables, types and interfaces (tested with TypeScript).

This theme is dedicated to raise awareness about the Earth and changing climate, which is causing unprecedented natural disasters across the world.
